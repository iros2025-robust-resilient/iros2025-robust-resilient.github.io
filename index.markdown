title: IROS25 Workshop on Robust and Resilient AI-enabled Robots
---

To responsibly integrate AI-enabled robots into society, we must ensure their behavior is both robust in unexpected environments and tasks and capable of generating resilient behaviour when needed. This necessitates addressing a fundamental question: How can AI methods enhance robustness and resilience of robots? Achieving this requires a holistic approach that accounts for multiple interacting factors across a robot’s entire lifecycle—beyond a narrow focus on individual attributes such as safety. A crucial component is the ability of robots to learn from experience, adapting to novel situations and improving performance over time. Additionally, designing robust and resilient robotic systems necessitates advancements in system-building methodologies, including robot software architectures, rigorous testing frameworks, and comprehensive evaluation strategies. This workshop aims to bring together two key, yet often decoupled research communities in robotics: those developing AI methods for robotics and those working on robustness, resilience, and robot software engineering. By fostering collaboration between these fields, we seek to establish a comprehensive framework for long-term, reliable robot autonomy.

The workshop aims to bridge the gap between AI-driven robotics research and robot robustness, resilience, and robot software engineering by fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.
